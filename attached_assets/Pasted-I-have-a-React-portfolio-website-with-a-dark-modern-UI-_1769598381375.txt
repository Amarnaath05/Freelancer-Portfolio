I have a React portfolio website with a dark, modern UI and Framer Motion already set up.

I want to RESTRUCTURE the existing Projects section into TWO clear sections:

1) Client Projects
2) Personal / Advanced Projects

====================
STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
====================

SECTION 1: Client Projects
- Show projects completed for real clients
- Each project card must display:
  • Client name
  • Client type (Startup / Founder / Business / Personal Brand)
  • Project name
  • Short 1–2 line description
  • My role (e.g., Full-Stack Developer, AI Automation Engineer)
  • Tech stack as tags
  • Optional badge: “Client Project”
  • Optional link to testimonial or case study
- Maintain the existing dark UI theme and card layout
- Visually emphasize trust, credibility, and professionalism

SECTION 2: Personal / Advanced Projects
- Show self-initiated or experimental projects
- Each project card must display:
  • Project name
  • Short description
  • Project type (Full-Stack / AI / Automation / Cloud)
  • Tech stack tags
- Do NOT show any client information in this section

====================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
====================

• Separate project data into two arrays:
  - clientProjects[]
  - personalProjects[]

• Create reusable React components:
  - <ProjectCard />
  - <ClientProjectsSection />
  - <PersonalProjectsSection />

• Use functional React components
• Keep layout responsive
• Keep styling consistent with the existing design
• Do NOT break existing navigation, routes, or theme
• Keep code clean, modular, and scalable

====================
UX ORDER (IMPORTANT)
====================

Hero
Services
Client Projects
Testimonials
Personal / Advanced Projects
Skills
Process
CTA (Hire Me)

====================
FRAMER MOTION ENHANCEMENTS
====================

Add subtle, premium Framer Motion animations:

• Fade + slide animation when sections enter the viewport
• Smooth staggered animations for project cards
• Slight scale-up on hover
• Gentle pseudo-3D tilt effect on project cards using CSS perspective

Example behavior (do not hardcode values everywhere):
- rotateX and rotateY on hover
- scale slightly on hover
- perspective applied at the card container level

Animations must be:
• Subtle and professional
• Performance-friendly
• Not distracting
• Fully responsive and mobile-safe

====================
OPTIONAL VISUAL POLISH
====================

You may add:
• Depth hover glow using box-shadow
• Soft floating abstract background elements (SVGs or gradients only)
• Very slow motion drift for background visuals

Do NOT add:
• Heavy 3D libraries
• Three.js scenes
• Particle systems
• Over-animated effects

====================
DELIVERY
====================

Implement this change fully in React.
Preserve the existing UI look and feel.
Focus on clarity, professionalism, and portfolio best practices.
